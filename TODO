Bootstrap

 type-safe hot-swap, lets me add rules/actions/contexts, without risking being mute

 make a Haskell server (one route for a list of words)

 Phrase should "bootstrap-suffice"

 trans-compile: "NarcissisticGrammar", exclusive and allResults

 set it all up on the work laptop, with "$ cabal install commands"

 Yesod: setSession for the dynamic list vocabulary on the client (e.g. all tokens in current Emacs buffer)

 Haskell: spawn another thread to keep polling the current application

 make an Emacs server, responds with current buffer
